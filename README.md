# Getting Started with React Router

This is a basic router repository [Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Notes

Some useful notes:
1. path="/" , / here redirects to the main page...
2. path="*" , * here means any path without the declared ones..... One more important thing is to set this "*" path at very last position.... 

### 5 Steps to create simple Routing
1. install react router....
2. import BrowserRouter Component in index.js file.... Use <BrowserRouter> Component to wrap <App>....
3. declare <Routes> as parent of <Route> Component in app.js....
4. declare path="" inside route as props.... "/" and "*" is interesting.....
5. declare element={} after path in props...... inside element declare the component to set on that declared path....
