# Getting Started with React Router

This is a basic router repository [Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Notes

Some useful notes:
1. path="/" , / here redirects to the main page...
2. path="*" , * here means any path without the declared ones..... One more important thing is to set this "*" path at very last position.... 

### 5 Steps to create simple Routing
1. install react router....
2. import BrowserRouter Component in index.js file.... Use <BrowserRouter> Component to wrap <App>....
3. declare <Routes> as parent of <Route> Component in app.js....
4. declare path="" inside route as props.... "/" and "*" is interesting.....
5. declare element={} after path in props...... inside element declare the component to set on that declared path....


### dynamic link, and useNavigate  Hook

1. import and declare useNavigate() hook in navigate function
2. create and add event handler to call the function containing useNavigate() Hook
3. onClick set dynamic link in parent function of hook... 
  e.g(navigate(`/users/${id}`))

  ### About Navbar functions....

  1.  1st way to simply route using anchor tag... But the problem is it reloads when page loads......

  2. To solve that we need to use <Link> or <CustomLink> Components in React and (to) instead of (href)......


  ### about dynamic url, url parameter and useParams() Hook...

  1. Dynamic part lands on the exact element whether exists or not.
  2. Dynamic part is called url Parameters
  3. In That Component that dynamic part reaches to we can Capture the Dynamic part or Parameter given by using the name we used in route e.g(:name), and utilize that....


  ### Nested Routing..
  1. Parent Route is as usual a simple Route with path and Parent Element... e.g(Posts)
  2. to navigate from UI set a link in nav.....
  3. Load posts using useEffect hook and set posts using useState hook.....
  4. Mapping posts got single post... Created a link by name of post id for every single post.....
  5. Now Here in this link we set a to={} dynamic knowing /posts/id is what we want....
  6. name this path (/:postID) in Child Route inside /posts... This name (postID) is very important.....
  7. Child Route element is set to a PostDetail Component......
  8. inside PostDetail we Catch the path name using that name destructured in useParams Hook.......
  9. using that variable of postID that we got  using useParams() hook we dynamically create URL to load single post data and Show in Post detail Component after we set the single post data to post variable.....
